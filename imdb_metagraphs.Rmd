<h2>Data Preparation </h2>


- *IMDB* 
Original (.list) files are parsed into a set of CSV files for movies (titles), actors, and actresses.  An inner join results into a data.frame that contains 
the titles and authors in those movies.  From these data.frame vertices 
and edges output files are created, then concatenated into a single SUBDUE graph
format input-file (.g).


<h2>Toy Graph</h2>



```{r, echo=FALSE}
# from http://www.r-bloggers.com/network-visualization-in-r-with-the-igraph-package/
require(igraph)
# Load the data. The data needs to be loaded as a table first: 
bsk<-read.table("imdb_data/imdb_100.ig") 
bsk.network<-graph.data.frame(bsk, directed=F) #the 'directed' attribute specifies whether the edges are directed
plot(bsk.network)
```
