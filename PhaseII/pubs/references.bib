abstract ={Over the past decade, there has been an explosion of interest in network research across the physical and social sciences. For social scientists, the theory of networks has been a gold mine, yielding explanations for social phenomena in a wide variety of disciplines from psychology to economics. Here, we review the kinds of things that social scientists have tried to explain using social network analysis and provide a nutshell description of the basic assumptions, goals, and explanatory mechanisms prevalent in the field. We hope to contribute to a dialogue among researchers from across the physical and social sciences who share a common interest in understanding the antecedents and consequences of network phenomena.},

abstract ={We survey the concept of assortativity, starting from its original definition by Newman in 2002. Degree assortativity is the most commonly used form of assortativity. Degree assortativity is extensively used in network science. Since degree assortativity alone is not sufficient as a graph analysis tool, assortativity is usually combined with other graph metrics. Much of the research on assortativity considers undirected, non-weighted networks. The research on assortativity needs to be extended to encompass also directed links and weighted links. In addition, the relation between assortativity and line graphs, complementary graphs and graph spectra needs further work, to incorporate directed graphs and weighted links. The present survey paper aims to summarize the work in this area and provides a new scope of research.},

abstract ={Motivation: Protein complexes integrate multiple gene products to coordinate many biological functions. Given a graph representing pairwise protein interaction data one can search for subgraphs representing protein complexes. Previous methods for performing such search relied on the assumption that complexes form a clique in that graph. While this assumption is true for some complexes, it does not hold for many others. New algorithms are required in order to recover complexes with other types of topological structure.Results: We present an algorithm for inferring protein complexes from weighted interaction graphs. By using graph topological patterns and biological properties as features, we model each complex subgraph by a probabilistic Bayesian network (BN). We use a training set of known complexes to learn the parameters of this BN model. The log-likelihood ratio derived from the BN is then used to score subgraphs in the protein interaction graph and identify new complexes. We applied our method to protein interaction data in yeast. As we show our algorithm achieved a considerable improvement over clique based algorithms in terms of its ability to recover known complexes. We discuss some of the new complexes predicted by our algorithm and determine that they likely represent true complexes.Availability: Matlab implementation is available on the supporting website: www.cs.cmu.edu/~qyj/SuperComplexContact: zivbj@cs.cmu.edu},

abstract = "One of the main approaches to performing computation in Bayesian networks (BNs) is clique tree clustering and propagation. The clique tree approach consists of propagation in a clique tree compiled from a BN, and while it was introduced in the 1980s, there is still a lack of understanding of how clique tree computation time depends on variations in \{BN\} size and structure. In this article, we improve this understanding by developing an approach to characterizing clique tree growth as a function of parameters that can be computed in polynomial time from BNs, specifically: (i) the ratio of the number of a BN's non-root nodes to the number of root nodes, and (ii) the expected number of moral edges in their moral graphs. Analytically, we partition the set of cliques in a clique tree into different sets, and introduce a growth curve for the total size of each set. For the special case of bipartite BNs, there are two sets and two growth curves, a mixed clique growth curve and a root clique growth curve. In experiments, where random bipartite \{BNs\} generated using the \{BPART\} algorithm are studied, we systematically increase the out-degree of the root nodes in bipartite Bayesian networks, by increasing the number of leaf nodes. Surprisingly, root clique growth is well-approximated by Gompertz growth curves, an S-shaped family of curves that has previously been used to describe growth processes in biology, medicine, and neuroscience. We believe that this research improves the understanding of the scaling behavior of clique tree clustering for a certain class of Bayesian networks; presents an aid for trade-off studies of clique tree clustering using growth curves; and ultimately provides a foundation for benchmarking and developing improved \{BN\} inference and machine learning algorithms.

    abstract= "How can we generate realistic networks? In addition, how can we do so with a mathematically tractable model that allows for rigorous analysis of network properties? Real networks exhibit a long list of surprising properties: Heavy tails for the in- and out-degree distribution, heavy tails for the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, small diameters, and densification and shrinking diameters over time. Current network models and generators either fail to match several of the above properties, are complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. Here we propose a generative model for networks that is both mathematically tractable and can generate networks that have all the above mentioned structural properties. Our main idea here is to use a non-standard matrix operation, the Kronecker product, to generate graphs which we refer to as “Kronecker graphs”. First, we show that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network properties. In fact, we rigorously prove that they do so. We also provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real networks. We then present KRONFIT, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to fitting would take super-exponential time. In contrast, KRONFIT takes linear time, by exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by using statistical simulation techniques. Experiments on a wide range of large real and synthetic networks show that KRONFIT finds accurate parameters that very well mimic the properties of target networks. In fact, using just four parameters we can accurately model several aspects of global network structure. Once fitted, the model parameters can be used to gain insights about the network structure, and the resulting synthetic graphs can be used for null-models, anonymization, extrapolations, and graph summarization."

abstract ={Algorithms for finding structure in data have become increasingly important both as tools for scientific data analysis and as models of human learning, yet they suffer from a critical limitation. Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g., “bigger than” or “better than”) respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.},

Abstract = {{Data clustering, including problems such as finding network communities,
   can be put into a systematic framework by means of a Bayesian approach.
   Here we address the Bayesian formulation of the problem of finding
   hypergraph communities. We start by introducing a hypergraph generative
   model with a built-in group structure. Using a variational calculation
   we derive a variational Bayes algorithm, a generalized version of the
   expectation maximization algorithm with a built-in penalization for
   model complexity or bias. We demonstrate the good performance of the
   variational Bayes algorithm using test examples, including finding
   network communities. A MATLAB code implementing this algorithm is
